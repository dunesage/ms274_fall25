In this project, I will investigate the effects of internal waves on temperature dynamics in Monterey Bay. (Note: modified on 10/24 to include initial conditions from the high-resolution 1/48 degree LLC4320 global simulation, in order to include internal wave generation during the model run.) I plan to run my model for a few months, with ~0.5 GB hourly boundary condition files for THETA, SALT, UVEL, and VVEL. An interesting comparison could be between runs with conditions from different seasons of the LLC4320 simulation. I plan to compare temperature dynamics in different locations in Monterey Bay and visualize internal wave activity from the model. Two important diagnostic variables I will consider are vertical velocity (w) and stratification (buoyancy frequency), as these are crucial for understanding the propagation of internal waves.
