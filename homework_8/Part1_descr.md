In this project, I will investigate the effects of internal waves on temperature dynamics in Monterey Bay. Although my Part 4 notebook is currently using ECCO's Version 4 model output, I will modify this to include initial/boundary conditions from the high-resolution 1/48 degree LLC4320 global simulation, in order to include internal wave generation. I plan to run my model for a few days, with ~0.5 GB hourly boundary condition files for THETA, SALT, UVEL, and VVEL. An interesting comparison could be between runs with conditions from different seasons of the LLC4320 simulation. I plan to compare temperature dynamics in different locations in Monterey Bay and visualize internal wave activity from the model. Two important diagnostic variables I will consider are vertical velocity (w) and stratification (buoyancy frequency), as these are crucial for understanding the propagation of internal waves.
